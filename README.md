### Important tips

  - Create one user manually in database (this becomes an administrator that can handle all users such as admins/faculties).
  
  - Once an admin elevates a faculty member to an admin role, they cannot revoke or revert their access back to a faculty role. 

  - Therefore, the first user, who is created manually with admin rights, is essential for ensuring proper role management and system integrity.

  - The first user, created manually with administrative privileges, should be used only when absolutely necessary, such as reverting an admin role back to a faculty role.

  - If you want to assign courses to faculties then you need to add the courses first then assign faculties to it.

  - Remeber the courses will assign only to the faculty members not to admins.
